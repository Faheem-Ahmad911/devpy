# DevPy Blog Setup and Management

## Blog Structure Created

Your blog subdomain structure has been successfully created at `blog.devpy.tech`. Here's what was set up:

### Directory Structure
```
blog/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main blog homepage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blog.css        # Main blog styles
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blog.js         # Blog functionality
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ post.css        # Individual post styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ posts/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ post-1.html     # Sample blog post
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Subdirectory Deployment
Deploy the `blog` folder as a subdirectory on your main domain:
- Main site: `https://www.devpy.tech`
- Blog: `https://www.devpy.tech/blog`

### Option 2: Subdomain Deployment
For a true subdomain at `blog.devpy.tech`, you'll need to:

1. **DNS Configuration:**
   - Add a CNAME record pointing `blog.devpy.tech` to your hosting provider
   - Or add an A record pointing to your server's IP address

2. **Server Configuration:**
   - Configure your web server (Apache/Nginx) to serve the blog folder for the subdomain
   - Example Nginx configuration:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name blog.devpy.tech;
       root /path/to/devpy/blog;
       index index.html;
       
       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
   }
   ```

### Option 3: Separate Hosting
Deploy the blog folder to a separate hosting service:
- Vercel: Connect your repository and set build output to `blog/`
- Netlify: Deploy the `blog` folder as a separate site
- GitHub Pages: Create a separate repository for the blog

## Content Management

1. **Create a new HTML file** in the `posts/` directory (e.g., `post-2.html`)

           title: "Your New Post Title",
